- ## Model
	- Machine Learning (ML) model that is being used by OP to control the vehicle.
	- Each new model released by Comma has been trained on real driving data from humans.
	- Generally given an acronym like CH or LA of FV, etc...
	- OP gives you only the current model, however many forks give a choice of which model you want to use.
	- There is some consensus on certain aspects of each model amongst the community, however everyones drives and roads and vehicles are different so it is generally best to try them all and see what works best for you and your unique situation.
